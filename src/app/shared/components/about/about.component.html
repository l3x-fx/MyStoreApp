  <h1>About MyStore</h1>
  <p>
    Allow me to introduce my latest Full Stack project. MyStore is a showcase of
    my skills in FullStack development. It was built using a modern technology
    stack:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      On the front end, I utilized <b>TypeScript</b> and <b>Angular</b> to
      create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
    </li>
    <li>
      For state management, I employed <b>NgRx</b> to ensure an efficient data
      flow throughout the application.
    </li>
    <li>
      On the back end, I harnessed <b>Node.js</b> and <b>Express</b> to develop
      a robust and performant API.
    </li>
    <li>
      The application's data is stored and managed in a
      <b>PostgreSQL</b> relational database, ensuring data integrity and
      reliability.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    MyStore encapsulates my dedication to creating visually captivating and
    functional websites to ensure an enjoyable user experience.
